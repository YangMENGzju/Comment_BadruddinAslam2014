# Cosmic rays and the Indian Summer Monsoon

A repository hosting the data, code, and figure outputs accompanying a paper re-examining the work of Badruddin &amp; Aslam (2015). An analysis of extremes in the Indian Monsoon in relation to solar activity.

This code works with both Python 2.7 or >3.4, although it requires some additional packages such as Pandas. I recommend using Anaconda python, and conda to install these.

N.b. I have created a Data/ folder which holds the required files for the analysis. However, these are not necessarily required, as currently the iPtython notebook is set up to fetch the same data from my own public server. I note that setting this to fetch to the data on the G-hub repo will not work however. If you wish to work without an internet connection, you will therefore need to download the data in Data/ locally, and link to the local files.
